# Goal
This project aims to create associations between some users and some centers of interest. What we mean by center of interest is a general concept: it could be a topic, an idea, an activity, an artist, a political view, a belief system, etc... (we could even extend its scope)
A user will be able to:
- Create an account.
- Create some centers of interest.
- Add an affinity between himself and a center of interest.
- Merge centers of interest (to avoid duplication).
- Browse centers of interest pages, users and affinities (when he has the authorization).
